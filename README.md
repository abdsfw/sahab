### sell screen

On this screen, you can sell to students using the internet or even without an internet connection. However, in the latter case, an internet connection is required when initially accessing the interface to fetch and store the latest student data. After that, sales can be conducted offline, with all information stored on the device's memory. Once an internet connection is available, the data can be uploaded to the server using the "Upload" button.
