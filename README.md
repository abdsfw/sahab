### onboarding

The application includes a structured onboarding flow designed to enhance user experience:
Splash Screen: The app begins with a splash screen that displays the logo and brand identity, creating a visually appealing first impression while initializing the application.
Advertisement Page: After the splash screen, users are directed to an advertisement page. This page can display promotional content or important information relevant to the appâ€™s services.
Language Selection Page: Finally, users are prompted to select their preferred language for the app interface during their first entry into the app. This ensures localization and improves accessibility for users from different linguistic backgrounds.
